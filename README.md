- 👋 Hi, I’m Lisa, a Full-Stack Developer passionate about solving real life problems with code. My background is in healthcare(crazy career change, right?), but my love for Tech and building meaningful life-changing projects overtook me (the heart wants what it wants 🥰).

- 👀 I’m interested in using data for good by building front-end and back-end projects that meet the daily needs of users.
- ❤️ I have a passion for front-end specifically.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on continuous learning.  (We know being a coder means being a student for life!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects and open to new job opportunities
